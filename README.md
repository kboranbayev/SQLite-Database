# SQLite-Database

This repository contains source code for the SQLite database. 

The app itself is designed to simulate basic functional phone contacts. It has three inputs:
	1. Contact Name
	2. Phone Number
	3. Description

With help of SQLite, user is able to 
	1. insert a data into database;
	2. edit data (update, delete);
	3. view database content (not working).
	
	
Note
	Although database is working properly, it terminates immediately in cases of
		1. Initially having empty database, user tries to edit
		2. Having a single data, user deletes the data
	
	Viewing database content through "Display" is not possible in the meantime due to some code issues.
